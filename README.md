# [Flyonui](https://flyonui.com/) + [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) Integration

## Branch Overview

- **main**: Contains the FlyonUI Starter Kit integrated with Next.js, providing a foundational setup to begin your project.

- **components**: Showcases the implementation and usage of various FlyonUI components within a Next.js environment.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev # or npm start if you want to test build
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Production

The production build will generate client and server modules by running both client and server build commands. The build command will use Typescript to run a type check on the source code.

```shell
npm run build
```

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
